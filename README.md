# Heart tissue monitor

This is a project I'm working on during a 2 month lab rotation in a cardiology/physics lab. My goal is to create a real time frequency analyzer for 2D heart tissue using python and opencv. The ultimate goal is to eventually create an interactive GUI and save the frequency data without having to store large amounts of video for data analysis.
